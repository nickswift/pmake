A NOTE ON PATTERN MATCHING

We attempted to implement gmake's pattern matching feature, but were not
able to get full functionality. We were, however, able to build a set of
rules based on patterns, and we were able to use those rules
to find files in the working directory that matched the given patterns.

We then attempted to use the pattern rules as templates to build rules 
for each required matched file (eg. hello.c --> hello.o, and main.c --> 
main.o using the same rule) this is the requirement we didn't quite 
finish, but we are confident that this is essentially what needs to 
happen.
